Our aim for this project is to create an Endless Runner type of game using Unity.

What is an Endless Runner?

An endless runner is a type of video game where the player controls a character who continuously moves forward through a level or environment with no end in sight. The primary objective in endless runner games is to keep the character running for as long as possible while avoiding obstacles and collecting items or power-ups. “Temple Run” and “Subway Surfers” are the two most famous games that fit inside this category.

 Subway Surfers



		“Go, Johnny, Go!”
	
As mentioned previously, our project will consist in developing an “Endless Runner” game. The goal of the  game will be to keep the character running for as long as possible, while collecting coins that can be later used to buy new characters or upgrades.
	The main tool that will be used in the development of our project will be Unity.
	For the scripting necessary for character movements and other game logic, we will use Visual Studio Code.
The assets used in this game will will be obtained from the Unity Assets Store ( environment ) and Mixamo ( characters ).
	This game will be developed for Android users.

	Some of the core mechanics of our game will be as follows:
•	Continuous Forward Movement: The player's character automatically moves forward without input.

•	Player Controls: Players have control over the character's actions as follows:

o	Swipe left/right: Character moves left / right

o	Swipe up: Character jumps

o	Swipe down: Character slides

•	Obstacles:The game features various obstacles, such as barriers, trees, rocks, and moving hazards. Players must navigate these obstacles by using their control inputs at the right time.

•	Collectibles: Players can collect items like coins or gems. These collectibles can be used to purchase in-game items or upgrades. They also contribute to the player's score.

•	Score System: Players earn points based on their performance. Points are awarded for distance covered, collectibles collected.

•	In-Game Store: Players can spend in-game currency to purchase upgrades or characters.

•	Character Customization: Players will be able to create their own custom character inside the game.

•	Multiple play maps: Players will be able to enjoy multiple unique environments where the can earn coins and have fun, each with their own special challanges. ( for example: Desert, City, Jungle etc)
